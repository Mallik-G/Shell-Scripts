# Merge Multiple CSVs

## Problem Statement
There are multiple csv files in a directory with similar data e.g. sales data for multiple years. Each file has a header. We want to merge all these files but want only the header from the first file. This script solves the problem

## How to run ?
Change the FILE variable in the script so that it points to the directory which contains all the csv files and run the scipt. The output would get stored in testFile.csv
